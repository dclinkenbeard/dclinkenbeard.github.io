# Neovim

Why am I "wasting" time working on this? Well I enjoy it. It is fun to learn lua, it is fun to work in nvim. It is fun to learn new things

I used vi on [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) way back in the day and vim not long after that. So coming back to nvim feels like going home.

I am also using this as an opportunity to learn more about al-folio.
