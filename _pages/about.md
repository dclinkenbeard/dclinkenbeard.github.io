Hi! I'm Dr. Drew Clinkenbeard — a computer science professor at [CSU Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu), a software developer, and a mentor passionate about experiential learning.

I hold a Ph.D. in Education, and I blend that background with my technical work to support student success in computing. My interests span software design, backend systems, and game development — especially projects that offer students real-world experience building something meaningful.

Outside the classroom, I’m building a nonprofit studio where students can collaboratively develop and release games, learn professional workflows (like version control, Agile methods, and design patterns), and grow their portfolios.

Some of my current technologies and tools include:

- Programming Languages: Java, PL/SQL, C#, and TypeScript (in progress)
- Frameworks: Unity (2D/3D game dev), Spring Boot, React Native
- Tools: GitHub, Docker, Gradle, IntelliJ, Rider, and more

In addition to my academic and technical work, I enjoy coffee, baking, weightlifting, and martial arts. I believe in work-life balance, creative expression, and helping others find confidence through building.

If you're interested in working with me — whether you're a student, collaborator, or fellow educator — feel free to [get in touch](mailto:dclinkenbeard@csumb.edu) or explore my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/dclinkenbeard).

Thanks for visiting!
